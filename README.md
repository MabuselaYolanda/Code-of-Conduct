We respect and uplift the dignity of all persons and we assume this respect will be rhetoric to the persons themselves. It is expected that members will exhibit a conventional conduct of good behavior and respect the platform they are given - leaders of the GKSS body that serve our common society. 
 
Not in any way will any member be subjected be misappropriation that will disrespect their dignity, rights and entitlement. Such behavior will not be tolerated in all spheres and platforms of Geekulcha as an organization. 
 
Sexual Harassment is very intolerable within the organization and members are encouraged to come forward and report such acts. Members alleged in such acts will face DC which may lead to suspension/expulsion from the GKSS body. 
 
5.6 Skills Development 
 
Members must use the platform they are in to uplift their skills and further develop their career. Geekulcha operate on 5 pillars of its skills policy: Acquirement, Realization, Development, Redistribution and Utilization. These 5 pillars seek to ensure that there is skills transformation within Geekulcha in which members will gain skills and transfer to the Geekulcha community. 
 
These strategies will be used to ensure skills development of the GKSS members: Train The Trainer, tech events attendance, resources through the Geekulcha Crew portal and access to mentorship.

As a Data-centric organization, Geekulcha will provide a list of tools to gather, process and present information as needed. 
 
5.9 Value and Compensation 
 
Being part of the GKSS body connects students to closer to Geekulcha, it's platforms and resources for work and collaborative opportunities.
